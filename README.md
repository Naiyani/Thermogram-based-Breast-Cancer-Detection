Integrating Machine Learning with Vision Transformer, Canny, and Gaussian Edge Detection for Thermogram-Based Breast Cancer Detection

Breast cancer is a widespread and life-threatening issue, especially in developing 
nations where the cost of conventional screening poses a significant barrier to accessibility. 
In response, we propose an affordable and effective breast cancer detection method using 
thermography applicable across diverse age groups.
- Our approach involves a computer-aided 
system utilizing thermal breast images and a pre-trained Vision Transformer model as a 
feature extractor for a specialized classifier. By enhancing input data with edge maps 
generated from a Gaussian Gradient edge detector, and leveraging the self-attention 
mechanism of the Vision Transformer through transfer learning, our system proves effective. 
- Our research is all about making healthcare technology available to more people, 
especially in areas where regular screenings are too expensive.
- Our system uses 
thermography and a smart model to offer a low-cost way to detect breast cancer early, 
breaking down economic barriers. This not only helps those who can't afford expensive 
screenings but also supports global efforts to find breast cancer sooner and save more lives.
 
Vision Transformer model, a powerful deep learning architecture, to analyse 
thermal data. The proposed approach aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of breast 
cancer detection using non-invasive thermogram imaging. 

The results demonstrate the potential of Vision Transformers to achieve reliable 
and effective early-stage breast cancer identification, contributing to advancements in 
medical imaging and diagnosis.
